# sbb-orders-scraper
This project is to filter trough a SBB CFF FFS oders PDF from (sbb.ch)[https://www.sbb.ch/de/kaufen/pages/bestellung/bestellungen.xhtml].

At the end of the year, I had to submit a report detailing my work-related travel to a specific client's office, including the number of trips and their associated costs.
The SBB system doesn't offer advanced filtering options; it only allows users to download a PDF containing all orders from the past year. 
As a result, I had to create my own filtering solution.
