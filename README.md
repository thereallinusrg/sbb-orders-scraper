At the end of the year, I had to submit a report detailing my work-related travel to a specific client's office, including the number of trips and their associated costs.
The SBB system doesn't offer advanced filtering options; it only allows users to download a PDF containing all orders from the past year.
As a result, I had to create my own filtering solution.

## How to use

Download your Orders PDF for the time you want to analyze.
Then import it into the Jupyter Notebook and give it a go.
